Neutron (name to be changed) is a desktop front-end for Spansh's popular [Neutron Router](https://www.spansh.co.uk/) for the space exploration, trading, and combat game, Elite: Dangerous. In addition to everything the Neutron Router offers, this front-end also provides real-time updates as you play, automatically copying new systems into your clipboard, and updating the remaining jump counts.

## Features

* Long-range route plotting
* Less time per route by plotting to discovered neutron stars
* Real-time updates on remaining jumps and upcoming systems
* A sexy interface

## Installation

Currently, Neutron is Windows x64 only, however I will expand it to macOS and Linux / BSD in the very near future. The primary Elite: Dangerous userbase is Windows, so I don't feel *too* bad about my laziness.

To install, go to the [latest release]( https://github.com/winneon/neutron/releases/latest), download the setup.exe file, and run it! It's that simple! Neutron should be available as shortcuts on your desktop and start menu afterwards.

## Credit

Obviously, I could not have done this without Spansh's amazing [Neutron Router](https://www.spansh.co.uk/) tool. I've used his/her tool countless times, and it has saved me so much time when going on a long trip across the galaxy. Be sure to check it out!
